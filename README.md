# PCL

a simple language that compiles into c#, and uses a lot of lua syntax. will be mainly used for unity but plan on adding support for normal c# in the future.

# Example

```lua
local variable1 = "big fat blueberry balls";
local variable2 = "balls";

fun Start()
{
    if variable1 == "big fat blueberry balls"
    {
        Console.WriteLine("chicken");
    }
}
```
